# UI Directory

## What is a UI directory?

### 1. Visual Components:

This is where we build visual components, creating building blocks of code that match what exists in Figma.

### 2. Reusable Code:
It is very common that the way your component looks (UI) stays the same for _much_ longer than the way your component gets data (Business logic). We might change where we get the data about our filters in the future but it will still look the same, so we want to have the code for the two concerns in different folders.


## Why have a separate UI directory? (ChatGPT answer)

### 1. Maintainability:

**Without Separation**: If you put all the logic and UI together in a single component, it can become bloated and difficult to understand. A single change in one part of the component might inadvertently affect other parts.

**With Separation**: By separating business logic from the UI, you make each piece simpler and easier to understand. You can work on the logic or the presentation independently, making the codebase more maintainable and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

### 2. Reusability:

**Without Separation**: If UI and logic are intertwined, you can't use one without the other. If you want to use the same UI with different logic (or vice versa), you would have to duplicate code or make complicated modifications.

**With Separation**: By keeping the UI separate from the logic, you can easily reuse the UI component with different logic or apply the same logic to a different UI. This makes your codebase more flexible and efficient.

### 3. Testability:

**Without Separation**: Testing a component that mixes UI and business logic can be challenging. You may have to create complex mock states and interact with the UI in ways that don't directly test the logic.

**With Separation**: By isolating the business logic, you can write unit tests that focus specifically on the functionality, without needing to interact with the UI. Similarly, you can test the UI component by providing mock logic or state, focusing solely on how the component renders and behaves.

### 4. Scalability:

**Without Separation**: As your application grows, a monolithic component can become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.

**With Separation**: Separating concerns allows you to scale more easily, as you can develop, test, and optimize different parts of the application independently.

### 5. Collaboration:

**Without Separation**: If everything is in one component, developers working on the UI could easily interfere with those working on the logic, leading to conflicts and misunderstandings.

**With Separation**: Different team members (or even teams) can work on the UI and logic separately, improving collaboration and efficiency.
